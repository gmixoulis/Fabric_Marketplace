# Enterprise Asset Marketplace: Fabric ERC721

## ⛓️ Project Overview

**Fabric Marketplace** is an enterprise-grade blockchain solution implementing the **ERC721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** standard on **Hyperledger Fabric**. Unlike public chain NFTs, this project demonstrates how digital assets can be managed in a permissioned, privacy-preserving consortium environment suitable for supply chain or corporate asset tracking.

## 🔑 Key Features

-   **Chaincode Implementation**: Custom business logic written in Node.js implementing the `fabric-contract-api`.
-   **ERC721 Compliance**: Adapts the popular Ethereum standard for the Hyperledger permissioned model (Minting, Transferring, Burning).
-   **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test suite using `Mocha`, `Chai`, and `Sinon` to ensure contract reliability.
-   **Linting & Quality**: Enforced code quality standards with `ESLint`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

-   **Blockchain Framework**: Hyperledger Fabric v2.x
-   **Language**: JavaScript / Node.js
-   **Testing**: Mocha, Chai, Sinon
-   **Concepts**: Chaincode Development, Permissioned Blockchains, Asset Tokenization

## 💡 Innovation

This project bridges the gap between **DeFi standards (ERC721)** and **Enterprise Blockchain**. It showcases the ability to architect complex token economies within private networks, a highly sought-after skill in the corporate blockchain sector.

## 🚀 Usage

To start the chaincode in dev mode:

```bash
npm start
```

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```
